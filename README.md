## Momentum Slider

The goal here was to create a light weight responsive slider that can optionally be used for navigation or image galleries. The most important part of this was maintaining a user friendly smooth drag (on desktop and mobile) that still allows the user to be able to throw the navigation around and still snap to each item. The project also has right-to-left support and can be initialize as many times as needed on a page.
